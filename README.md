# Urban Grocers - API Testing with JavaScript and Jest

## Project description

Urban Grocers is a delivery service that offers a diverse range of grocery items sourced from various warehouses. The back-end API of Urban Grocers serves as a tool for retrieving information related to warehouses, grocery products, kits, and orders.

The primary objective of the project involved testing multiple endpoints. Tests were created using the JavaScript testing framework Jest, specifically focusing on GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

To provide clarity, automated tests were implemented for the subsequent endpoints:

-   Getting a kit by name
-   Getting a list of deliveries
-   Getting a list of warehouses
-   Adding items to a kit
-   Checking availability of goods in warehouse
-   Checking quantity of goods in warehouse
-   Creating a user account
-   Updating price of grocery items
-   Updating a kit
-   Deleting a kit

## Documentation source used

The primary documentation source utilized was the apiDoc documentation seamlessly integrated with the Urban Grocers server.

## Technologies and techniques used

Tests in Visual Studio Code were developed using the Cypress testing framework. The applied techniques stem from the foundational principles of API testing, with a significant focus on scrutinizing the response's structure and ensuring data integrity.
